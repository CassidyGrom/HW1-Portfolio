            <p>Hello! I am a professional journalist and developer-in-training. You may have seen my work on <a href="NJ.com">NJ.com</a> or the <a href="nydn.com">New York Daily News.</a> I love helping people understand their neighbors and the world the
                live in. Over the past year, you could find me <a href="nj.com/nuns"> talking to nuns</a> and <a href="placeholder">gang leaders alike.</a> New Jersey is a facsinating state, with endless true stories to tell. So I'm excited to continue
                my work by becoming a full-stack developer. Check back to this site throughout the year to see my coding progess.

                I'm from Kentucky, which I'm convinced is God's land. It's beautiful. We have these things called knobs, which are taller than hills but smaller than mountians. Those knobs are home to some unique american music, namely Bluegrass. Bluegrass employes a
                range of string instruments and tends to showcase the banjo.

                Kentucky is also known for the Derby, a famous horse race that draws the attention of celeberties and dignitaries from around the world. They wear large, artistic hats and bright suits when they attend. For locals, the Derby is more than a two-minute
                horse race. We have some sort of festival every weekend for the month leading up to the race. Some of my favorite events include the hot-air ballon glow, and Thunder over Louisville, a giant firework show that occurs over the Ohio river.
